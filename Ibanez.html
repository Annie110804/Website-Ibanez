   <h1 style="color: rebeccapurple">Hi my love <3 </h1>
     <h5 style="color: blueviolet">Happy national boyfriend's day</h5>

       <p style="color: darkseagreen">Last time I made you a website, it didn't exactly work out as I expected it to. So, with the help of remembering some of the stuff I learned in my web design class in high school and a youtube video, I can now present to you <b>you're very own fully functional website.</b> 
    
    <p style="color: darkseagreen"> Honestly, when I first tried making you a website, I remembered how painfully boring and time-consuming it was to actually, yk, create a website using coding. Therefore I sought out an easier, less custom, method and landed on a website that creates website templates for you.</p>
       
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">Unfortunately, I failed to actually keep the website because in order to maintain the website you customized, you had to pay a monthly bill. I was young and broke then and so I chose to use a free trial...Well, time did its thing, it passed, and with that my free trial came to and end. You'd think because I'm older now, I'd have the money to get that website back but uhh..I am very much still young and broke. For a while now I've been meaning to put my lil tech creative skills to use and make sum for you, but I just didn't know what to make. I then thought I should make you another website, but this time, it'll actually be ours.</p>

       <p style="color: darkseagreen">I won't lie to you, I'm not a big fan of all this coding stuff, but I am, however, quite a superfan of making you happy. And if there's a possibility this "handmade" website might make you smile, then I will remain on this route. To be fully transparent with you, another big reason why I wanted to make you this is because lately I've been reflecting on us. I'm so sorry I get snappy on you when you try to just love me. I'm making you this website on Wednesday, August 2 of 2023 at 12:50 am and currently things aren't the best here at home. My family stresses me out. I love them, but sum times it's draining to act like I'm not bothered. I bottle up this frustration and end up taking it out on you or Pollito, by pushing you guys away (if Polltio could testify, she'd be agreeing on this). I'm really, sincerely sorry.</p>
       
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">I think at times, I forget you're young and just a human. I, without realizing, expect you to always have the answers, to always know how to fix my broken thoughts, I, unintentionally, put so much pressure on you. Idk if you've noticed or not, but I really am sorry for all of that too. You're a lot more than just a problem-fixer to me. You're a charming, young man who is likeable and funny. A blessing to those who meet you. Sometimes I really do feel like I'm not worthy of dating you lmao. I have huge admiration for you Ibanez, I'm proud of the person you've become and I pray God continues to guide and use you. </p>
       
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">I know this website may look like just one long letter that I could've just written or typed out and sent it to you, but I like the idea of our website being out there somewhere floating in the internet and hey, maybe 100 years from now (if humanity still exists) someone might stumble on this page. I hope our love remains alive even when we're gone. I hope our decendants get to love like we did. Call me silly for this one, but I do hope a little bit that our love will reach us when we get to heaven and see each other again. I pray our love will be an example of what true, healthy love is.</p>
       
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">Thank you sweet boy for all the laughter you've brought out of me, even in the moments when I'm tryna keep a pokerface. Thankful is an understatment of how I feel about you being in my life. I'm sure there's a word that means a higher level of grateful, but Idk it unfortunately. Just know, God's heard a LOT of "thank you for Jair" 's in my prayers.</p>
       
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">Please always continue to be my silly, sassy, loving Jair. May God continue to bless your path and if God allows it, may I get the honor of being in your path with you for forever and always. <3333</p>
           
       <p style="color: darkseagreen">With lots and I mean LOTS of love, YO WIFE (send noods pls ty)</p>
